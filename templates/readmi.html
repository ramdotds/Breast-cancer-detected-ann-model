                <p>
                    Cancer arises when the abnormal bodyâ€™s cells start to separate and come in contact with normal cells
                    and make them malignant. Breast cancer is most frequently occurring and harmful disease in the
                    world. Breast cancer considered either invasive or non-invasive. Invasive is cancerous, malignant
                    and
                    spreads in other organs. Non-invasive is pre-cancerous, remains in its original organ. It eventually
                    develops into invasive breast cancer. The portion of body that contains the breast cancer is glands
                    and
                    milk ducts that carry the milk. Breast cancer spread to other organs frequently and make them
                    malignant. It also spreads through the bloodstream to other organ. Breast cancer has many types and
                    the rate of growing is also different. According to WHO, 627,000 women died from the breast cancer
                    in 2018. Breast cancer is the main problem that spreads everywhere in the world but mostly found in
                    United State of America. There are four types of breast cancer. First type of cancer is Ductal
                    Carcinoma in Situ that found in the coating of breast milk ducts and it is pre-stage breast cancer.
                    Second type of breast cancer is most popular disease and contains upto 70-80% diagnosis. Third type
                    of breast cancer is Inflammatory breast cancer which is forcefully and quickly developing breast
                    cancer in this disease cells penetrate the skin and lymph vessels of the breast. The fourth type of
                    breast
                    cancer is Metastatic breast cancer which is spreads to other parts of the body.

                <p>
                    The approach uses more dependent variables and is supervised learning. The result of this procedure
                    is a binary number. For a certain set of data, logistic regression can provide a continuous outcome.
                    This approach uses a statistical model with binary variables .

                    The same amount of time was spent on each class in order to identify the trend. K Nearest Neighbour
                    pulls the relevant highlighted data from a huge dataset. We use feature similarity to categorise a

                    Decision trees are built using classification and regression models . There are fewer subsets of the
                    data set. These smaller data sets may be used to make predictions with the highest degree of

                    This method makes use of a huge training dataset. The algorithm used to determine probability uses
                    the Bayesian approach . It provides the highest level of accuracy for estimating the input
                    probabilities of noisy data . This classifier compares training datasets and training tuples using

                    Breast cancer detection is a challenging problem because it is most popular and harmful disease.
                    Breast cancer is growing every year and there is less chance to recover from this disease. For
                    detection
                    of breast cancer, machine learning and deep learning techniques are used. It is concluded from the
                    previous research, the machine learning techniques give better results in their own field. The
                    previous
                    research is conducted through many machine learning techniques with some enhancement and
                    augmentation in dataset for the better performance. But it is concluded that machine learning gives
                    better results on linear data. It is also concluded from the previous research, when the data is in
                    the
                    form of images where the machine is failed. To solve the problem of machine learning techniques, an
                    innovative technique is used.
