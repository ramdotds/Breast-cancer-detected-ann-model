# **Breast Cancer Detection Deep Learning ANN Model**

### *Introduction*-:
Cancer arises when the abnormal bodyâ€™s cells start to separate and come in contact with normal cells
and make them malignant. Breast cancer is most frequently occurring and harmful disease in the
world. Breast cancer considered either invasive or non-invasive. Invasive is cancerous, malignant and
spreads in other organs. Non-invasive is pre-cancerous, remains in its original organ. It eventually
develops into invasive breast cancer. The portion of body that contains the breast cancer is glands and
milk ducts that carry the milk. Breast cancer spread to other organs frequently and make them
malignant. It also spreads through the bloodstream to other organ. Breast cancer has many types and
the rate of growing is also different. According to WHO, 627,000 women died from the breast cancer
in 2018. Breast cancer is the main problem that spreads everywhere in the world but mostly found in
United State of America. There are four types of breast cancer. First type of cancer is Ductal
Carcinoma in Situ that found in the coating of breast milk ducts and it is pre-stage breast cancer.
Second type of breast cancer is most popular disease and contains upto 70-80% diagnosis. Third type
of breast cancer is Inflammatory breast cancer which is forcefully and quickly developing breast
cancer in this disease cells penetrate the skin and lymph vessels of the breast. The fourth type of breast
cancer is Metastatic breast cancer which is spreads to other parts of the body.

### *Python Libraries which used in this project*-:
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Sklearn
etc.
For version see the requirements.txt file.

### *Data Source*-:
Kaggle Dataset

### *Data Analysis or Feature Scaling with EDA*
Completely Analyse the data and droped the unimportant features. Correlation for target is much important for model.plot the diffirent types of chart with diffirent types of features.
We scaled data with standard scaler and got better accuracy or dicrease the loss.

### *Model Train with Diffirent types of Machine Learning algorithms *-:
*Logistics Regression (LR)*-:
The approach uses  more dependent  variables and  is supervised learning. The result of this procedure  is a binary number. For a certain set of data, logistic regression can provide a continuous outcome. This approach uses a statistical model with binary variables .

 *K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)*-:
This approach is used to recognise patterns. It is a useful method for forecasting breast cancer. The same amount of time was spent on each class in order to identify the trend. K Nearest Neighbour  pulls the relevant highlighted data from a huge dataset. We use feature similarity to categorise a huge dataset .

*Decision Tree (DT)*-:
Decision trees are built  using classification and regression models . There  are fewer  subsets of the data set. These smaller data sets may be used to make predictions with the highest degree of accuracy.

*Naive Bayes Algorithm (NB)*-:
This method makes use of a huge training dataset. The algorithm used to determine probability uses the Bayesian approach . It provides the highest level of accuracy for estimating the input probabilities of noisy data . This classifier compares training datasets and training tuples using analogies .

*Support Vector Machine (SVM)*-:
This supervised learning method addresses both classification and regression concerns . In order to deal with the regression  issue,  it employs  mathematical  and theoretical functions.  It delivers  the  highest  accuracy rate  when making predictions  using a  large dataset.  It is a  potent machine learning  technique that is  based on 3D  and 2D modelling.

*Random Forest (RF)*-:
Classification and  regression problems are  handled using  the  Random Forest algorithm  , which is  based on supervised learning. It is a  machine learning building  block that utilises historical datasets to  forecast fresh data .

*K Mean Algorithm*-:
Data can be sorted into manageable categories using the clustering technique K mean. Algorithms are used to assess how similar different data points are to one another. Every data point contains the most suitable cluster for analysing a sizable dataset .
XGBOOST solve classification or regression problem and provides better accuracy in machine learning models.

### *Diffirent types of methods for Testing or Model Ananlysis*-:
confusion metrix
classification report
precision or recall scores
roc-curve
etc.
model.summary

### *Conclusion*-:
Breast cancer detection is a challenging problem because it is most popular and harmful disease.
Breast cancer is growing every year and there is less chance to recover from this disease. For detection
of breast cancer, machine learning and deep learning techniques are used. It is concluded from the
previous research, the machine learning techniques give better results in their own field. The previous
research is conducted through many machine learning techniques with some enhancement and augmentation in dataset for the better performance. But it is concluded that machine learning gives
better results on linear data. It is also concluded from the previous research, when the data is in the
form of images where the machine is failed. To solve the problem of machine learning techniques, an
innovative technique is used.
